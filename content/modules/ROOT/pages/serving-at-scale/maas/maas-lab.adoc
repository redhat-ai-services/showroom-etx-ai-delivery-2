= 3Scale API Gateway

In this module, you will learn how to configure 3Scale API Gateway to give access to the models previously deployed in the first lab.

== 3Scale Overview

=== Connection to 3Scale Admin Portal

3Scale is an API management platform that provides a way to manage, secure, and analyze APIs. It allows you to create and manage API keys, set up rate limits, and monitor API usage.

To connect to the 3Scale admin portal, you will need the *admin_user* and *admin_password* values. They can be found in the `system-seed` secret in the `3scale` namespace.

* From a Terminal (in your VSCode workbench) log into OpenShift as the _cluster administator_.
+
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc login -u {user} -p {password} --server={openshift_api_url}
----
+
(approve the certificate when prompted to allow insecure connections)

* Now that you are logged in, you can get the secret values with the following commands:
+
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get secret system-seed -n 3scale -o template='{{range $key, $value := .data}}{{if or (eq $key "ADMIN_USER") (eq $key "ADMIN_PASSWORD")}}{{printf "%s: " $key}}{{ $value | base64decode }}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}'
----

Now you can log into the 3Scale admin portal as the _admin_ user at https://maas-admin.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://maas-admin.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank] using the credentials you just retrieved.

You will be prompted by a wizard window. Close it by clicking on the top right corner of the screen.

=== Enabling access to the Developer Portal

Developer Portal allows API providers to create a customizable, branded interface for onboarding developers, sharing API documentation, and managing access credentials. It supports content management, theming, and integration with backend services to streamline API consumption.

A user (non-admin) was already created for you in 3Scale in (Audience->Accounts->Listing), but you still need to configure the developer portal to allow users to access it.

* On the Audience section, got to Developer Portal->Settings->Domains & Access.
+

* The Developer Portal Access Code is used to control the access the developer portal. Simply delete it and click on `Update Account` to remove the access code and allow anyone to access the developer portal, although they will still need to authenticate. 


=== Retrieve the Routes for the vLLM models deployed in the previous lab

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get routes -n vllm -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,URL:.spec.host
----
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

== Configuring 3Scale

You are ready to create a new Products for the models you deployed in the previous lab. To do that we are going to use the 3Scale operator. This will show you how you can fully automate the deployment of new models in your service.

The resources to be deployed are: 

1. *Backend* -> Address of the hosted model 
1. *Product* -> Defines the mapping rules, security, metrics and policies for the model endpoint
1. *API document* -> OpenAPI definition of the service
1. *API ProxyConfigPromote* -> Promotes the product into production

[NOTE]
You will need to deploy one of each of these resources for every model you're accessing.
Each model will require a unique *name, systemName, productSystemName*. We recommend using the `actual model name` as it would be passed in a request.


[NOTE]
All of the following commands are done via the OpenShift UI via the *Quick Create* UI element


image::serving-at-scale/maas/create-resources.png[]


=== Creating the backend for the product

* Edit the following yaml to add the address of your hosted model and then paste the yaml into the UI.

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: Backend
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1

  name: llama70b
  namespace: 3scale

  systemName: llama70b
----

=== Creating a new 3Scale Product 

Copy and paste the following _yaml_ into the UI

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]

=== Creating the API document for the product

* Copy and paste the yaml into the UI.

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1
kind: ActiveDoc
metadata:
  name: llama70b
  namespace: 3scale
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: 3scale
spec:
  activeDocOpenAPIRef:
    url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-ai-services/etx-serving-at-scale/refs/heads/main/manifests/llama70b-chat.json'
  name: llama70b
  productSystemName: llama70b
  published: true
  skipSwaggerValidations: true
  systemName: llama70b
----

[NOTE]
For this lab we will reuse the same url above for all models as they provide the same interface.

=== Finally create the ProxyConfigPromote

When a new Product is created, it is only available in a "staging" environment. This means that it is not yet available to the users. You need to publish it to make it available. This is done via a _ProxyConfigPromote_ resource

* Copy and paste the yaml into the UI.

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kind: ProxyConfigPromote
apiVersion: capabilities.3scale.net/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: llama70b
  namespace: 3scale
spec:
  productCRName: llama70b
  production: true
----

* Finally, we must subscribe our user to this new product. Again, this is normally something you would automate as part of a deployment of a new product, but here we are going to do it in the 3Scale Admin Portal. Go to `Audience->Listing`, select `user1` account.
+
[.bordershadow]

image::serving-at-scale/maas/sub-model.png[]

* In the account section, select the `Service Subscriptions` tab at the right.

* At the bottom right of the page, click on the `Subscribe` button on the `LLama70B` item.

* Finally select the `Default` Plan and click on `Create subscription`.

=== Testing the Product

You can now test this new Product 

* Connect to the Developer Portal at `https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://maas.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain},window=_blank]` and log in using the `user1` & `openshift` credentials.

image::serving-at-scale/maas/login-button.png[]

* Click on the `See your Applications and their credentials` link on the front page.

* Click on the `Create new application` button.

image::serving-at-scale/maas/create-application.png[]

* Select the `LLama70B` service.

image::serving-at-scale/maas/select-service.png[]

* Enter a name for your application, for example `LLama70B application`. Click on `Create Application`.

[.bordershadow]
image::serving-at-scale/maas/app-created.png[]

* Your application has been created. You can see the `Endpoint URL` you can use to connect to the API and the `API key` that has been generated for you. You can now use this key to access the API.

[NOTE]
Due to a bug in this version of the solution the `Model Name` is not displayed. 

* You can now test the API using the `curl` command in your terminal. Open a terminal in your VSCode environment (or on your laptop) and run the following command, replacing the placeholder values with the ones you got from the previous step:
+
[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -X 'POST' \
    '___ENDPOINT_URL___/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer ___API_KEY___' \
    -d '{
    "model": "___MODEL_NAME___",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
----

Example:

[source,bash,role="execute",subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://tinyllama-maas-apicast-production.apps.cluster-br294.br294.sandbox5291.opentlc.com:443/v1/completions' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer 5924457cf136e9906c5c98cc5924ab7a' \
    -d '{
    "model": "llama70B",
    "prompt": "San Francisco is a",
    "max_tokens": 15,
    "temperature": 0
}'
----

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new Product in 3Scale and connected it to the `Llama70B` model.
